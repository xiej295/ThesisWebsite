          <h5>Introduction</h5>
          <p>My project is exploring people’s emotional relationships with objects and how digital technologies are transferring our collecting behaviours in a personal context. Whether we are savers, collectors  or compulsive cleaners, driven by the psychological factors to be safe, resourceful and reliable, collecting things gives us a lot of pleasure and contentment. Besides preserving the values of things and anticipating future usage, there are also motivations for hoarding to be reliving past events and expressing care. Things have gradually become our extended-self that tracing our life and making sense of our self-worth and identity. Hoarders display more emotional attachment to their physical collections versus digital possessions. However, with the development of the digital age, our hoarding behaviours are gradually digitized. In that case, how are people collecting behaviour changes? How does it influence the meaning attached to the collections and the corresponding people’s extended-self?</p>
          <p>Through a motion graphic that visualizes my digital collections with the corresponding interactions, I want to express the characteristics of the digital collections, numerous, ephemeral and jumbled. They only appear when you are accessing them, and usually, a few snippets are coherent to form a complete story. How we form and justify our attachments to objects is the question I want to bring up to my audience. Through this project, I want my audience to rethink their relationship with their things and help them regulate their hoarding behaviours and emotional well-being.

          <h7>Concept Statement</h7>
          <p>How do we form and justify our attachments to objects?</p>
          <p>My thesis is exploring how digital technologies are transferring our collecting behaviours in a personal context? With the prevalence of digital media, collecting practices are gradually changing from physical items to digital possessions. Huge storage space and convenient storage methods provide more convenience for our collections of photographs, videos and audios. The main psychology reasons behind this phenomenon are care-seeking, fear of losing, and actively seeking for bounded control. Both physical and virtual possessions have become an integral part of users’ extended self and emotional wellbeing. Hoarders display excessive emotional attachment to objects and tend to anthropomorphize their belongings. Through my interviews with the audiences, 70% of the participants prefer physical collections to digital collections. They suggested that they have a more emotional attachment to material items because they carry more related memories. While they seldom look back to their large and disorganized digital possessions. In that case, with everything gradually digitized, how are people’s collecting behaviours changed? How does it influence the meanings attached to the collections and the corresponding people’s extended-self?

          <h5>Context</h5>
          <h7>Hoarding Behaviours and Emotional Wellbeing</h7>
          <p>One manifestation of people’s emotional attachment to objects is hoarding behaviours. The hoarding behaviours described here are different from compulsive hoarding. It refers to the emotional attachment generated by the memory represented by the item and the people involved. According to a journal “Digital hoarding behaviours: Underlying motivations and potential negative consequences” published in Computers in Human Behavior, hoarders display excessive emotional attachment to their collections and tend to anthropomorphize their belongings[5]. The level of EOI (emotional over-involvement) is significantly higher among the individuals who hoard than the non-hoarders. Care seeking and fear of losing are the two primary behaviours hoarders have toward inanimate objects, compared with the less effectiveness of making use of them. Women are more likely than a man to be a hoarder[6].
          </p>
          <br/>

          <h7>Digital Hoarding Behaviours</h7>
          <p>Digital Hoarding is defined as the over-accumulation of digital materials such as emails, photographs, files and software[10]. With the proliferation of smart devices, the explosion of information, and the abundance of cheap storage with large capacity, hoarding behaviours go digitally. Digital hoarding is not that visible as physical hoarding; for this reason, it can cause trouble in our lives without being aware of it[1]. A large amount of information may slow down our retrieval and make it difficult for us to find the point. Keeping all the information is equivalent to leaving nothing just for its advantage that we don’t need to make decisions.
          </p>
          <p>Digital possessions could be regarded as a kind of self-extension, and it may influence people's behaviour or therefore influence maintaining practices, or the actions associated with saving or personal information[11]. Research “Exploring aspects of the cognitive-behavioral model of physical hoarding in relation to digital hoarding behaviours” done by Susan Thorpe, Alexander Bolster, and Nick Neave in 2019 pointed out that during their assessment, participants showed secure emotional attachment to digital possessions. This conclusion is especially correct for photographs and videos.
          </p>
          <br/>

          <h7>Emotional Attachment to Objects and Anthropomorphism</h7>
          <p>Animistic thinking is a common phenomenon and originates in early childhood. It is easy to be triggered by the human likeness of the inanimate objects, through which the same empathy mechanism towards humans will be activated. The “human likeness” mentioned above not only refers to how the objects look like human beings but also includes the emotional relationship between human beings and objects[26]. That could explain how not only robots but also clothes, papers, etc. could trigger the same feelings. During this process, we add a layer of “imaginative perception” to objects based on our cognition and project our emotions towards them. Through fixing their sufferings, we may gain a sense of satisfaction.

          <h7>Precedent: The Birth of Venus by Guannan Chen</h7>
          <p>牡蛎/the birth Venus is Guannan Chen’s thesis project in the Central Academy of Fine Arts of China. It is an ecological system that produces pearls of different shapes based on the objects you put in. It is a bionic machine that mimics the behaviour of oysters.

          <br/>
          </center>
          <p> It is a bionic machine that mimics the behaviour of oysters. Guannan Chen pearlized her rings, keys, badges, brooches, all of which are meaningful to her[27].</p>

          <p>牡蛎/the birth of Venus</p>
          <br/>
          </center>
          <p>The Birth of Venus elicits people’s attention to what they treasure and provides a creative ritual for people to turn their objects into pearls. It allowed us to rethink what they value, how they preserve, and what makes the most sense for them. It is also a discussion between rebirth and eternity.
          </p>
          <p>I resonate strongly with this project, and it makes me think about how I preserve my treasures and what makes the most sense for myself. It is a great way to protect physical items, but what about the digital ones. Is there anyway to collect, preserve and present our digital collections. How could that experience be more satisfying and meaningful? What is people’ reactions and thoughts towards their digital treasures? Those questions are all that this project inspired me.

          <h7>Waste Not by Song Dong</h7>
          <p>Song Dong is a Beijing-based artist who has been at the forefront of conceptual art since the 1990s in China. Waste Not is part of the exhibition The Elaine Dannheisser Projects series that was exhibited in MOMA. Waste Not is an installation that presents all of Dong’s mother's belongings in different series and colours. Dong’s mother, Zhao Xiangyuan lived in the generation that went through a lot of hardships and Culture Revolution in China. The centural value system during that era is everything that should not be wasted so that her small housed are crowded with all kinds of used items for further usage[28].

          <p>Waste or not in MOMA</p>
          <br/>
          </center>
          <p>This project is an excellent example of how the social and cultural background influences people’s hoarding behaviours and the main psychology effect among the hoarders that those items could be saved for future purpose. As an exhibition, it reflects the characteristics of a particular historical period and its impact on people. For the author himself, it reflects his attitude and nostalgia for his mother through the collection of objects. It is also a reflection of the relationship between objects and people and between people and society.
